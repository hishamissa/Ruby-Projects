# Ruby Projects

This repository contains a collection of Ruby projects completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Ruby curriculum. These projects build foundational and advanced skills in Ruby programming, ranging from basic syntax exercises to more complex, object-oriented applications.

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes clean, well-documented code designed to reinforce the best practices in Ruby development.

## About The Odin Project

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a free, open-source full-stack web development curriculum. The Ruby path teaches programming fundamentals using Ruby and includes interactive lessons supported by hands-on projects.
